        The earliest version of <b>Supervisor</b> was developed in 2019 when I was a sophomore student.
        It accompanied me for a half year, and I kept myself self-disciplined with its assistance.
        But after then I indulged myself in playing computer games due to the Covid-19 Lockdown Policy,
        not using it anymore.
        Even worse, I lost all my source code after wrongly formatting my computer without pushing it to any remote
        repository.

      <Typography variant='body1' mb={1}>
        Now, I am suffering from the desperation of solitary after immigrating to the United States,
        without a chance to go to university and pursue my favorite subject, computer science.
        Next month my family will move to Boston, a city with better social security than Chicago,
        where I am living right now. I hope I can restart my transient life there.
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant='body1' mb={1}>
        By remaking <b>Supervisor</b>, I want myself to delve into study once again, just like what I did three years
        ago.
        My friends, coworkers, classmates, teammates, all of you guys can supervise me and witness my growth and
        change.
